Contextual variables are introduced to define fuzzy validity domains of each sensor. The algorithm increases the reliability of the position information. A simulation of this algorithm is then made by fusing GPS and IMU data coming from real tests on a land vehicle. Bad data delivered by GPS sensor are detected and rejected using contextual information thus increasing reliability. Moreover, because of a lack of credibility of GPS signal in some cases and because of the drift of the INS, GPS/INS association is not satisfactory at the moment. In order to avoid this problem, the authors propose to feed the fusion process based on a multisensor Kalman filter directly with the acceleration provided by the IMU. Moreover, the filter developed here gives the possibility to easily add other sensors in order to achieve performances required.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) is the process of calculating one's current location by using the previously known position, and advancing that position over time using established or estimated speeds and trajectories (or alternatively stride lengths and directions). PDR plays an important role in modern life, including tracking locations of people and objects whenever GPS is not available. Self-contained PDR systems do not require an infrastructure, thus they can be used for rapid deployment in situations such as search and rescue, disaster relief or medical emergencies. Wearable sensors are often applied in self-contained PDR, but implementation varies in terms of the number, type and location of sensors used. Many algorithms are designed for PDR in order to reduce the error or drift of the final estimate, with various levels of success. There is a lack of comparison between these different methods and this systematic review of PDR for wearable devices provides a comprehensive overview that can inform further design optimizations. The aim of this article is to assess the quality of all available PDR literature with a focus on wearable sensors. It provides an outline of the state-of-the-art in the field by comparing the accuracy of different sensor layouts and algorithms. Further directions of research are suggested based on these results. This study also highlights the need for more standardised and robust assessment protocols to capture real-world tracking performance of PDR methods. \textcopyright{} 2001-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The demand for navigation and positioning is increasing in various fields nowadays. Although Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are currently the most widely used high-accuracy positioning method, their operation rests on signal transmission and reception, which is prone to interference from obstacles such as high-rise buildings, thereby limiting indoor navigation. In addition, in highly dynamic scenarios, the low update rate of the signal cannot track detailed motions. In this case, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) play an important role in serving as a complementary component. However, a single high-accuracy IMU is financially prohibitive. On the other hand, the lack of accuracy and stability limits the application of low-cost IMU in navigation. One way to improve the performance of low-cost IMU is to fuse multiple IMUs. This study focuses on the development of pedestrian navigation using multisensor integration of low-cost IMUs and magnetometers exploring different integration techniques to compare their performance. The Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) algorithm is a technique used to estimate the relative motion of pedestrian, which is a commonly used technology for indoor pedestrian navigation. This study use PDR with multi-sensor integration of low-cost IMUs to reduce the position error of pedestrian navigation to within one meter, with the aim of establishing a high-precision, reliable, and low-cost pedestrian navigation algorithm.},

  abstract = {Demand for indoor navigation systems has been rapidly increasing with regard to location-based services. As a cost-effective choice, inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) systems have been developed for years because they do not require external devices to be installed in the environment. In this paper, we propose a PDR system based on a chest-mounted IMU as a novel installation position for body-suit-type systems. Since the IMU is mounted on a part of the upper body, the framework of the zero-velocity update cannot be applied because there are no periodical moments of zero velocity. Therefore, we propose a novel regression model for estimating step lengths only with accelerations to correctly compute step displacement by using the IMU data acquired at the chest. In addition, we integrated the idea of an efficient map-matching algorithm based on particle filtering into our system to improve positioning and heading accuracy. Since our system was designed for 3D navigation, which can estimate position in a multifloor building, we used a barometer to update pedestrian altitude, and the components of our map are designed to explicitly represent building-floor information. With our complete PDR system, we were awarded second place in 10 teams for the IPIN 2018 Competition Track 2, achieving a mean error of 5.2 m after the 800 m walking event. \textcopyright{} 2019 by the authors.

For vehicular platforms, wheel odometry has been used to enhance the accuracy of SLAM. However, wheel odometry is not available in body-mounted platforms. Using raw inertial measurement unit (IMU) as odometry is not accurate enough to support SLAM due to the large and rapid drifts caused by IMU data integration. To address this challenge, we propose a sensor fusion scheme for body-mounted SLAM that integrates the IMU-based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) model with a low-cost lightweight 2D LiDAR sensor. In the proposed fusion, the PDR model is used as a replacement for wheel odometry in vehicular platforms. A system prototype consisting of a helmet-mount IMU from Xsens and RPLIDAR A1 2D LiDAR sensor has been developed and used for field data collection. The developed PDR model was integrated into the Cartographer SLAM engine and compared with Hector SLAM. Our experiments demonstrated that the integration of PDR has enhanced the SLAM accuracy and contributed in bridging featureless portions of the environment leading to an overall average improvement of 71.47\%.},

Future u-Health monitoring systems will be essential equipment for mobile users under the ubiquitous computing environment. It is well known that the cost of energy expenditure in human walk or run changes with the speed of movement. Also the accurate walking distance is an important factor in calculating energy expenditure in human daily life. In order to compute the walking distance precisely, the number of occurred steps has to be counted exactly and the step length should be exactly estimated as well. However the step length varies considerably with the movement's speed and status. Therefore, we recognize the movement status such as walk or run of a pedestrian using the small-sized MEMS inertial sensors. Based on the result, a step length is estimated adaptively. The developed method can be applied to PNS and health monitoring mobile system.},

To improve the self-positioning accuracy, this paper proposed a novel indoor self-localization algorithm using two kinds of automatic calibration methods, i.e., opportunistic magnetic trajectory matching and indoor landmark identification. Extensive experiments performed in two representative indoor environments, including an office building and a supermarket, demonstrate that the proposed self-localization algorithm can obtain an 80 percentile localization accuracy of 1.4m and 2m in the two representative indoor environments, respectively, which outperforms the art-of-the-state PDR algorithms.},

Based on our previous study on Wheel-INS [1], a wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning (DR) system, in this paper, we propose a multiple IMUs-based DR solution for the wheeled robots. The IMUs are mounted at different places on the wheeled vehicles to acquire various dynamic information. In particular, at least one IMU has to be mounted at the wheel to measure the wheel velocity and take advantage of the rotation modulation. The system is implemented through a distributed extended Kalman filter structure where each subsystem (corresponding to each IMU) retains and updates its own states separately. The relative position constraints between the multiple IMUs are exploited to further limit the error drift and improve the system's robustness. Particularly, we present the DR systems using dual Wheel-IMUs, one Wheel-IMU plus one vehicle body-mounted IMU (Body-IMU), and dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU as examples for analysis and comparison. Field tests illustrate that the proposed multi-IMU DR system outperforms the single Wheel-INS in terms of both positioning and heading accuracy. By comparing with the centralized filter, the proposed distributed filter shows unimportant accuracy degradation while holding significant computation efficiency. Moreover, among the three multi-IMU configurations, the one Body-IMU plus one WheelIMU design obtains the minimum drift rate. The position drift rates of the three configurations are 0.82\% (dual Wheel-IMUs), 0.69\% (one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU), and 0.73\% (dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU), respectively.},

Where it is used in several systems such as Driving Safety Support Systems (DSSS), autonomous driving and traffic mobility. In the current paper, we propose an inter-vehicle distance measurement system for self-driving based on image processing. The proposed system uses two cameras mounted as one stereo camera, in the hosting vehicle behind the rear-view mirror. The detection of vehicles is performed first in a single camera using a recent powerful work from the literature. Then, the same vehicle is detected in the image captured by the second camera using template matching technique. Thus, the inter-vehicle distance is calculated using a simple method based on the position of the vehicle in both cameras, geometric derivations and additional technical data such as distance between the cameras and some other specific angles (e.g. the cameras view field angle). The results of the extensive experiments showed the high accuracy of the proposed method compared to the previous works from literature and it allows to measure efficiently the distances between the vehicles and the hosting vehicle. In addition, this method could be used in several systems of various domains in real time regardless of the object types. The experiments results were done on a Hardware Processor System (HPS) located in a VEEK-MT2S provided by TERASIC.},

In the basic pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system, especially in the foot-tie PDR system, zero-velocity update method with Kalman filter are two core algorithms. In the basic PDR system, ZUPT usually uses a single threshold to judge the gait of pedestrians. A single threshold, however, makes ZUPT unable to accurately judge the gait of pedestrians in different road conditions. In this paper, we propose a new, redesigned ZUPT method without using additional equipment and filter algorithms to further improve the accuracy of correction results. The method uses a sliding detection algorithm to help re-detect the zero-velocity intervals, aiming to remove the pseudo-zero velocity interval and the pseudo-motion interval, as well as improving the performance of the ZUPT method. The method was implemented in a shoe-mounted IMU-based navigation system. For walking step detection tests, the accuracy of the proposed modified ZUPT method reached 87.24\%, 25\% higher than the conventional methods. In a long-distance walking path tracking test, the mean error of the estimated path of our method is 0.61 m, an 81.69\% reduction compared to the conventional ZUPT methods. The details of the improved ZUPT method presented in this paper not only enable the tracking technology to better track a pedestrian's step changes during walking, but also provide better calculation conditions for subsequent filter operations.},
