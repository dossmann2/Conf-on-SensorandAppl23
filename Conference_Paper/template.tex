\section{Introduction}

In 2022 at least 240 injuries or deaths involving firefighters conduction firefighting operations in buildings were reported in the United States alone \cite{atemschutzunfälle.eu2023}. To improve safety while performing such dangerous tasks, it can be helpful to determine the exact position of firefighters performing such tasks. This can shorten rescue time of injured personnel or help the firefighters avoid dangerous situations. To determine the position of a person in a building, a Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) approach is used. PDR is a navigation technique used to estimate the position and movements of pedestrians in indoor or GPS-denied environments. It relies on sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers integrated into smartphones, smartwatches, or wearable devices. By continuously tracking a pedestrian's step counts, stride length, and heading changes, PDR algorithms can calculate their relative displacement from a known starting point. Other means of PDR include simultanious locating and mapping (SLAM)\cite{lu2019}, Magnetic Field Mapping \cite{wang2016} or magnetic triangulation \cite{arumugam2020}. While PDR is most commonly used in Fitness and Smart devices, applications also include Robotics, Augmented Reality and Defense.\\

For an application in firefighting operations, many of the aformentioned methods are not feasable. While radio tracking \cite{cong2023}or magnetic mapping \cite{wang2016} yield good results, they are technologies that have to be set up before use. While it may be possible to achieve this for some large buildings, it would be impossible to do for every building in an area where a fire might occur. To be able to use the system in any indoor environment, a completely stand-alone, body-worn system is required. Stand-alone PDR systems often rely on a form of step-detection \cite{hou2021}. While step-detection algorithms yield good results when walking, movement occuring in a firefighting application includes more dynamic activities like crouching that are hard to detect by a step-detection algorithm. Therefore, a secondary sensor measuring position or velocity is necessary to improve accuracy in those cases. A common sensor chosen for this is a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor \cite{wang2016}. While this approach might yield good results, tests have shown that distance readings of LIDAR systems are heavily influenced by smoke particles and therefore are not usable in a firefighting environment. \\

The sensor chosen for extended Pedestrian Dead Reconing (PDR) is a stereo tracking camera. This sensor is able to measure velocity and position relative to a starting point and is combined with a step-detection algorithm. Position and velocity data from the tracking camera and position data from the step-detection are then fused in a Kalman filter to improve accuracy.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Materials and Methods}

The PDR relies on a sensor data fusion algorithm combining position data estimated by a step-detection algorithm and the velocity and position data estimated with a tracking camera.\\

\subsection{Step-Detection}
The step-detection is realized by analysing the acceleration signal of an IMU. The step-detection enhances a zero-crossing detection \cite{shin2007, zhao2022} with a threshold detection to improve the detection accuracy. The vertical acceleration signal firstly is filtered in a Lowpass filter (LPF) to remove the high frequency parts of the signal that occur during movement. Since the frequency range of normal human walking is in the range of $1-5\mathrm{Hz}$, the cutoff frequency of the LPF set to $10 \mathrm{Hz}$. The signal is then analysed by the step-detection algorithm: First the acceleration has to pass a set positive threshold $th_{max}$. After $th_{max}$ is passed, a zero crossing has to be detected and the acceleration has to fall below a negative threshold $th_{min}$. If $th_{min}$ is passed and another zero-crossing is detected, the step gets counted as completed. If the step is not completed in a set time limit or negative threshold is not passed the step-detection logic is reset and no step is counted.   \\ 

 After a step is detected, the length of the step is added to the last known position. The step length is estimated with the equation proposed by Weinberg \cite{weinberg2002}:
 \begin{equation}
 	d = \sqrt[4]{A_{max}-A_{min}}\cdot n\cdot k
 \end{equation}
 where $d$ is the distance traveled, $A_{max}$ is the maximum acceleration during a single step, $A_{min}$ is the minimal acceleration during a step, $n$ is the number of steps taken and $k$ is a constant for unit conversion. This method of step length estimation was chosen because it produces accurate estimates with low computational effort compared to other algorithms \cite{petukhov2022, shin2007, zizzo2017}. The step then gets added in the direction of movement which is determined by the heading angle measured by the IMU. It is assumed, that because of limited sight and movement during an indoor operation with self-contained breathing apparatus (scba), firefighters will in most cases move in the direction their body is pointed. [komischer Satz!]. Since the IMU is mounted on the air tank of the firefighter, the orientation of the IMU equals the direction of movement.\\
 
 
 A low cost IMU is chosen to measure the acceleration. The used deviced is the Bosch Sensortech BNO055 absolute orientation sensor. The device measures acceleration in three axes and provides absolute heading data by measuring the earths magnetic field. The sensor can provide a filtered heading angle.\\
 
 
 \subsection{Tracking Camera}
 As the secondary sensor a stereo tracking camera is used. Stereo tracking cameras work similarly to the human eyes: The device has two cameras that are placed with a distance to each other. By measuring the displacement of a tracked object between the two cameras, the distance to the object can be calculated. By doing this for multiple objects and repeating this process every frame, the position and average velocity can be calculated. The tracking camera chosen is the RealSense T265 stereo tracking camera. Its main advantage against competitors is the on-chip data processing, meaning that no other means of interpreting the data is necessary and the velocity and position data can be directly used for the sensor data fusion. By using parts of the infrared spectrum the camera also can produce accurate tracking results in environments with bad lighting.\\
 

 
 
 % Coordinate System/ Reference frame -> Appendix?
 For the measurements to be interpreted correctly, a global reference system $n$ has to be determined. This coordinate system is set by the staring position of the tracked Individual, where the starting location represents the $\left[0\;0\;0\right]$ coordinate origin and the direction the individual is looking the X-Axis (Heading angle $\alpha_h = 0$). The Z-Axis is the normal vector of a imagined plane the individual is standing on. The body reference frame $b$ of the two devices has to be rotated  into the global reference frame $n$. Since the tracking camera defines its starting-point and coordinate system by the same principles, the camera coordinate transformation gets performed by the device itself. For the IMU, a coordinate transformation has to be performed. Figure \ref{} shows the Global and Body coordinate systems
 \begin{equation}
 	\begin{bmatrix}
 		a_{x_n}\\
 		a_{y_n}\\
 		a_{z_n}
 	\end{bmatrix} = R_n^b \cdot
 	\begin{bmatrix}
 		a_{x_n}\\
 		a_{y_n}\\
 		a_{z_n}
 	\end{bmatrix}
 \end{equation}
 with the $R_{zxz}$ Transformation Matrix $R_n^b$: [QUELLE]
 \begin{equation}
 	R_n^b =\\
 	\begin{bmatrix}
 		\Phi  - \cos \beta \Delta &
 		\tau  + \cos \beta \epsilon &
 		\sin \beta \sin \gamma \\
 		- \epsilon -  \cos \beta \tau &
 		- \Delta +  \cos \beta \Phi &
 		\sin \beta  \cos \gamma  \\
 		\sin \alpha \sin \beta &
 		-\cos \alpha \sin \beta &
 		\cos \beta
 	\end{bmatrix}	
 \end{equation}
 where $\Phi = \cos \alpha \cos \gamma$, $\Delta = \sin\alpha\sin\gamma$ and $\tau \sin \alpha \cos \gamma$ and $\epsilon = \cos \alpha \sin \gamma$\\
 
 
\subsection{Sensor-Data Fusion}
 % Sensordata Fusion
To combine the different sensor measurements, a Kalman filter is used. The Kalman filter is an optimal recursive algorithm used in control systems and data assimilation to estimate the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. It maintains a probabilistic representation of the system's state, combining predictions from a mathematical model and observations to obtain a more accurate and stable estimation. The filter operates in two steps: the prediction step, where the system's state $\hat{x}$ is predicted with the state transition model. And the update step, where measurements are used to correct the predicted state by computing the Kalman gain, which balances the model's predictions and the actual measurements. This process continually refines the state estimate as new data becomes available, making it robust against noise and capable of handling real-time applications. The state transition model used assumes a constant acceleration between updates.\\

[Fehlt Beschreibung des Modells]\\


%\begin{equation}
%	\begin{bmatrix}
%		A_k \\
%		V_k\\
%		P_k
%	\end{bmatrix} = 
%	\begin{bmatrix}
%		A_{k-1}\\
%		\Delta t \cdot A_{k-1}^3  \\
%		\Delta t \cdot A_{k-1}^3 + \Delta t^2\cdot V_{k-1}^3
%	\end{bmatrix}
%	\label{SystemState}
%\end{equation}

 The measurements gained by the tracking camera and the step detection have to be combined in a way that takes their quality into account. The quality of the measurements is determined by:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Time since last step was detected. It is assumed that the probability of the step-detection algorithm returning the true position deterioates with time if no successing step is detected.
	\item Tracking Confidence of the Tracking Camera. The Tracking Camera is able to calculate and return a confidence value of the tracking results. 
\end{itemize}

For the step detection, three states are proposed: the time after the last step detection event is smaller or greater than 0.5 seconds or the event happened longer than 3 seconds ago. The assumption is, that after that time it can be assumed, that movement has occurred but was not detected by the step detection algorithm.\\


The tracking confidence returned by the camera can reach four states from zero to three, where three is the highest confidence and zero the lowest.
To combine the two measurements and take the confidence markers into account, a decision matrix is proposed. The decision matrix includes six cases. This approach was influenced by the approach chosen in \cite{caron2006}. Goal of this approach is to weight and combine the inputs to achieve the best measurement.  If the quality of both markers is bad, the step detection gets highly favoured, since it provides stable results, even in zero visibility environments. If the tracking confidence is high, the tracking camera measurements get highly favoured. Figure \ref{fig_confidence} shows a graphical representation of the decision matrix. The combination of the measurements is performed before they are used in the Kalman Filter. A combination factor $\alpha$ is calculated from the decision matrix and used for the combination of the two measurements.
\begin{equation}
	x_{k} = \alpha\cdot x_{step} + (1-\alpha)\cdot x_{camera}
\end{equation}  
where $x_{k}$ is the position measurement input, $x_{step}$ is the position estimate produced by the step-detection and $x_{camera}$ is the position estimate from the tracking camera. The same calculation is performed for the y-axis.
The Kalman filter is implemented in Matlab using the Tracking Kalman filter library. \\

% Description Experiment
\subsection{System Verification}
 % Sensor assembly
For experimantal verification of the system, a wearable sensor assembly is designed. Both sensors are mounted to the backplate of a self-contained breathing apparatus. This design imitates the movements and position of the sensors in a real world application.[Schlecht!!] The camera and IMU are housed to protect the electronics from damage. A 3D printed spacer seperates the sensor housings from the backplate to imitate the sensors being placed on the side of the pressurized air tank of the scba. Figure \ref{fig:Assembly} shows the experimental setup.\\
